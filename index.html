                <p>The Root Work Framework was developed by <strong>Dr. Shawn A. Hearn</strong>, Ed.D., J.D., a legal and educational professional, U.S. military veteran, and founder of Community Exceptional Children's Services (CECS).</p>
                
                <p>With certifications in Secondary Education, Educational Leadership, and Special Education (EBD endorsement), Dr. Hearn brings decades of experience serving students with disabilities, justice-involved youth, and communities affected by trauma.</p>
                
                <p>The framework is grounded in published research, including <em>"From Garden to Growth: Building Trauma-Informed STEAM Classrooms through Living Learning Labs"</em> and <em>"The Law of Learning: Education, Policy, and Legal Frameworks in K-12 Schools."</em></p>
